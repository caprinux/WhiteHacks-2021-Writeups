### Challenge Description
So, it's my friend's birthday soon and I want to surprise him. His name is Andrew Yeoh Boon How and I heard he's quite active on Twitter. Can you help me find out when is his birthday?
Note: Making any contact with the person is out of scope.

### Solution
_p.s. ill cut short my OSINT writeups because it's relatively simple and theres nothing much to comment on_

First, we google Andrew's full name in Twitter and we easily find his handle, https://twitter.com/andrewybh1997.

His twitter profile shows his birthday, 18 September, and his twitter handle suggests the year, 1997.

With that, we make the flag and there you go

```
WH2021{18091997} #in the format of DDMMYYYY as suggested by the flag placeholder in the ctf platform
```
