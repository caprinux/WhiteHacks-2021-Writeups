# The Cake still Tick-Tocking
---

### Challenge Description
Now that we found out when is his birthday, we need to find out his favourite cake! He might have other social media. Not really sure though, he never mentioned it to me. The only thing I know is that he said he often vlogged somewhere.

Hint: Try checking out all the common social media platform where he can do and submit vlog.

Note: Making any contact with the person is out of scope.

### Solution 

So the description mentioned **VLOG**. And the title mentioned **"Tick-Tocking"**

Hmmmmmmmmmm, ticktocking vlog, ticktockin vlog, ticktocki vlog, ticktock vlog, ticktok vlog, tiktok vlog, vlog tiktok.

Why does this sound so familiar owo

Okay, you probably got it faster than me. Andrew probably vlogs on tiktok. 

From part 1 of the OSINT challenge, we found his twitter and his handle was andrewybh1997.

Now we go to TikTok and search for his handle again and we do find his profile.

His profile has 1 video about him filming a lava cake, no talking and nothing else. Probably why he hasnt made it to my FYP yet?

Anyways, even before we go to the video, we see a pastebin link in his profile. https://pastebin.com/y9wisLHg

  <summary> After 5 minute of scrutinising the pastebin file, I felt **something**. </summary>
   super duperrrrrrrrrrrrr hungryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. It was just a recipe for a yummy chocolate lava cake...
</details>

Since the pastebin had nothing related to the competition, we go back to his tiktok and watch his video. https://www.tiktok.com/@andrewybh1997/video/6919710323868011778?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1

Suddenly, at the corner of my eyes, the shining bright flag flashed on the screen for a moment.

I immediately pressed Win + Alt + G to save a recording of the last 30 seconds of my screen, and I played back the moment where the ray of hope shined in my eyes.

There it was.
