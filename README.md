# WhiteHacks-2021-Writeups

A collection of the CTF challenges I solved in Whitehacks as Team Elmo :)

A grand total of 99 teams participated and unfortunately only ended at #20. 

Quite salty that we were too lazy to take the free CSIT village flags which could've boosted us to #16, welp.

There goes my first official CTF, Will be back next year hehe ;)
