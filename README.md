# WhiteHacks-2021-Writeups

### A collection of the CTF challenges I solved in Whitehacks as Team Elmo :)
#### A grand total of 99 teams participated and unfortunately only ended at #20. 
#### Quite salty that we were too lazy to take the free CSIT village flags which could've boosted us to #16, welp.
#### There goes my first official CTF, Will be back next year hehe ;)
